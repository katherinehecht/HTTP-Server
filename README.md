The entirety of our project executes successfully.

Contributions
-------------

Enumeration of the contributions of each group member.

Each member of this group worked evenly together to contribute to the overarching goal of the project.
We met consistently and switched who was coding each time we met. The vast majority of the code was discussed
amongst all of the group members while only one of us was actually coding at any time. There were rare
occurrences when one of us would go to office hours to get a part of the code debugged. Even in this case,
upon meeting again we shared any updates in the code so that everyone was in the same place regarding progress
with the project.
